I started with simply downloading a template for the blog. When I was creating an application before, I learned that there are starter templates for gatsby.js. And after looking at the templates, I've seen that they have many useful modules installed. I had to find and configure them on my own. Therefore I decided to go for templates when building my next app.

I knew what I wanted, a minimalistic next.js app with Typescript installed. I searched for it for a while and didn't manage to find anything interesting. Thankfully found this template on Vercel, without the Typescript, but with Nextra and RSS. I went for it since I thought the transformation of .js files to .tsx will be very easy.
