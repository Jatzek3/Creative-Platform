Creating the directories for the blog post was pretty straightforward as also copying the content of the folders. I didn't yet make changes to those files, and how frontmatter is handled. I expect some coding in the future to adapt these posts. 

It took me some time to write a blog post about Next.js. At the end of writing, I lacked some inspiration, but the blog post is ok.
